# Read Connected Data

Now that we have some data in both tables, let's select the data that is connected together.

The `team` table has this data:

<table>
<tr>
<th>id</th><th>name</th><th>headquarters</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td><td>Preventers</td><td>Sharp Tower</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td><td>Z-Force</td><td>Sister Margaretâ€™s Bar</td>
</tr>
</table>

And the `hero` table has this data:

<table>
<tr>
<th>id</th><th>name</th><th>secret_name</th><th>age</th><th>team_id</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td><td>Deadpond</td><td>Dive Wilson</td><td>null</td><td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td><td>Rusty-Man</td><td>Tommy Sharp</td><td>48</td><td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td><td>Spider-Boy</td><td>Pedro Parqueador</td><td>null</td><td>null</td>
</tr>
</table>

We will continue with the code in the previous example and we will add more things to it.

## `SELECT` Connected Data with SQL

Let's start seeing how SQL works when selecting connected data. This is where SQL databases actually shine.

If you don't have a `database.db` file, run that previous program we had written (or copy it from the preview above) to create it.

Now open **DB Browser for SQLite** and open the `database.db` file.

To `SELECT` connected data we use the same keywords we have used before, but now we combine the two tables.

Let's get each hero with the `id`, `name`, and the team `name`:

```SQL
SELECT hero.id, hero.name, team.name
FROM hero, team
WHERE hero.team_id = team.id
```

!!! info
    Because we have two columns called `name`, one for `hero` and one for `team`, we can specify them with the prefix of the table name and the dot to make it explicit what we refer to.

Notice that now in the `WHERE` part we are not comparing one column with a literal value (like `hero.name = "Deadpond"`), but we are comparing two columns.

It means, more or less:

> Hey SQL database ðŸ‘‹, please go and `SELECT` some data for me.
>
> I'll first tell you the columns I want:
>
> * `id` of the `hero` table
> * `name` of the `hero` table
> * `name` of the `team` table
>
> I want you to get that data `FROM` the tables `hero` and `team`.
>
> And I don't want you to combine each hero with each possible team. Instead, for each hero, go and check each possible team, but give me only the ones `WHERE` the `hero.team_id` is the same as the `team.id`.

If we execute that SQL, it will return the table:

<table>
<tr>
<th>id</th><th>name</th><th>name</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td><td>Deadpond</td><td>Z-Force</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td><td>Rusty-Man</td><td>Preventers</td>
</tr>
</table>

You can go ahead and try it in **DB Browser for SQLite**:

<img class="shadow" src="/img/tutorial/relationships/select/image01.png">

!!! note
    Wait, what about Spider-Boy? ðŸ˜±

    He doesn't have a team, so his `team_id` is `NULL` in the database. And this SQL is comparing that `NULL` from the `team_id` with all the `id` fields in the rows in the `team` table.

    As there's no team with an ID of `NULL`, it doesn't find a match.

    But we'll see how to fix that later with a `LEFT JOIN`.

## Select Related Data with **SQLModel**

Now let's use SQLModel to do the same select.

We'll create a function `select_heroes()` just as we did before, but now we'll work with two tables.

Remember SQLModel's `select()` function? It can take more than one argument.

So, we can pass the `Hero` and `Team` model classes. And we can also use both their columns in the `.where()` part:

```Python hl_lines="5"
# Code above omitted ðŸ‘†

{!./docs_src/tutorial/connect/select/tutorial001.py[ln:63-65]!}

# Code below omitted ðŸ‘‡
```

<details>
<summary>ðŸ‘€ Full file preview</summary>

```Python
{!./docs_src/tutorial/connect/select/tutorial001.py!}
```

</details>

Notice that in the comparison with `==` we are using the class attributes for both `Hero.team_id` and `Team.id`.

That will generate the appropriate **expression** object that will be converted to the right SQL, equivalent to the SQL example we saw above.

Now we can execute it and get the `results` object.

And as we used `select` with two models, we will receive tuples of instances of those two models, so we can iterate over them naturally in a `for` loop:

```Python hl_lines="7"
# Code above omitted ðŸ‘†

{!./docs_src/tutorial/connect/select/tutorial001.py[ln:63-68]!}

# Code below omitted ðŸ‘‡
```

<details>
<summary>ðŸ‘€ Full file preview</summary>

```Python
{!./docs_src/tutorial/connect/select/tutorial001.py!}
```

</details>

For each iteration in the `for` loop we get a a tuple with an instance of the class `Hero` and an instance of the class `Team`.

And in this `for` loop we assign them to the variable `hero` and the variable `team`.

!!! info
    There was a lot of research, design, and work behind **SQLModel** to make this provide the best possible developer experience.

    And you should get autocompletion and inline errors in your editor for both `hero` and `team`. ðŸŽ‰

## Add It to Main

As always, we must remember to add this new `select_heroes()` function to the `main()` function to make sure it is executed when we call this program from the command line.

```Python hl_lines="6"
# Code above omitted ðŸ‘†

{!./docs_src/tutorial/connect/select/tutorial001.py[ln:71-74]!}

# Code below omitted ðŸ‘‡
```

<details>
<summary>ðŸ‘€ Full file preview</summary>

```Python
{!./docs_src/tutorial/connect/select/tutorial001.py!}
```

</details>


## Run the Program

Now we can run the program and see how it shows us each hero with their corresponding team:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python app.py

// Previous output omitted ðŸ˜‰

// Get the heroes with their teams
2021-08-09 08:55:50,682 INFO sqlalchemy.engine.Engine SELECT hero.id, hero.name, hero.secret_name, hero.age, hero.team_id, team.id AS id_1, team.name AS name_1, team.headquarters
FROM hero, team
WHERE hero.team_id = team.id
2021-08-09 08:55:50,682 INFO sqlalchemy.engine.Engine [no key 0.00015s] ()

// Print the first hero and team
Hero: id=1 secret_name='Dive Wilson' team_id=2 name='Deadpond' age=None Team: headquarters='Sister Margaretâ€™s Bar' id=2 name='Z-Force'

// Print the second hero and team
Hero: id=2 secret_name='Tommy Sharp' team_id=1 name='Rusty-Man' age=48 Team: headquarters='Sharp Tower' id=1 name='Preventers'
2021-08-09 08:55:50,682 INFO sqlalchemy.engine.Engine ROLLBACK
```

</div>

## `JOIN` Tables with SQL

There's an alternative syntax for that SQL query from above using the keyword `JOIN` instead of `WHERE`.

This is the same version from above, using `WHERE`:

```SQL
SELECT hero.id, hero.name, team.name
FROM hero, team
WHERE hero.team_id = team.id
```

And this is the alternative version using `JOIN`:

```SQL
SELECT hero.id, hero.name, team.name
FROM hero
JOIN team
ON hero.team_id = team.id
```

Both are equivalent. The differences in the SQL code are that instead of passing the `team` to the `FROM` part (also called `FROM` clause) we add a `JOIN` and put the `team` table there.

And then, instead of putting a `WHERE` with a condition, we put an `ON` keyword with the condition, because `ON` is the one that comes with `JOIN`. ðŸ¤·

So, this second version means, more or less:

> Hey SQL database ðŸ‘‹, please go and `SELECT` some data for me.
>
> I'll first tell you the columns I want:
>
> * `id` of the `hero` table
> * `name` of the `hero` table
> * `name` of the `team` table
>
> ...up to here it's the same as before, LOL.
>
> Now, I want you to get that data starting `FROM` the table `hero`.
>
> And to get the rest of the data, I want you to `JOIN` it with the table `team`.
>
> And I want you to join those two tables `ON` the combinations of rows that have the `hero.team_id` with the same value as the `team.id`.
>
> Did I say all this before already? I feel like I'm just repeating myself. ðŸ¤”

That will return the same table as before:

<table>
<tr>
<th>id</th><th>name</th><th>name</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td><td>Deadpond</td><td>Z-Force</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td><td>Rusty-Man</td><td>Preventers</td>
</tr>
</table>

Also in **DB Browser for SQLite**:

<img class="shadow" src="/img/tutorial/relationships/select/image02.png">

!!! tip
    Why bother with all this if the result is the same?

    This `JOIN` will be useful in a bit to be able to also get Spider-Boy, even if he doesn't have a team.

## Join Tables in **SQLModel**

The same way there's a `.where()` available when using `select()`, there's also a `.join()`.

And in SQLModel (actually SQLAlchemy), when using the `.join()`, because we already declared what is the `foreign_key` when creating the models, we don't have to pass an `ON` part, it is inferred automatically:

```Python hl_lines="5"
# Code above omitted ðŸ‘†

{!./docs_src/tutorial/connect/select/tutorial002.py[ln:63-68]!}

# Code below omitted ðŸ‘‡
```

<details>
<summary>ðŸ‘€ Full file preview</summary>

```Python
{!./docs_src/tutorial/connect/select/tutorial002.py!}
```

</details>

Also notice that we are still including `Team` in the `select(Hero, Team)`, because we still want to access that data.

This is equivalent to the previous example.

And if we run it in the command line, it will output:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python app.py

// Previous output omitted ðŸ˜‰

// Select using a JOIN with automatic ON
INFO Engine SELECT hero.id, hero.name, hero.secret_name, hero.age, hero.team_id, team.id AS id_1, team.name AS name_1, team.headquarters
FROM hero JOIN team ON team.id = hero.team_id
INFO Engine [no key 0.00032s] ()

// Print the first hero and team
Hero: id=1 secret_name='Dive Wilson' team_id=2 name='Deadpond' age=None Team: headquarters='Sister Margaretâ€™s Bar' id=2 name='Z-Force'

// Print the second hero and team
Hero: id=2 secret_name='Tommy Sharp' team_id=1 name='Rusty-Man' age=48 Team: headquarters='Sharp Tower' id=1 name='Preventers'

```

</div>

## `JOIN` Tables with SQL and `LEFT OUTER` (Maybe `JOIN`)

When working with a `JOIN`, you can imagine that you start with a table on the `FROM` part and put that table in an imaginary space on the **left** side.

And then you want another table to `JOIN` the result.

And you put that second table in the **right** side on that imaginary space.

And then you tell the database `ON` which condition it should join those two tables and give you the results back.

But by default, only the rows from both left and right that match the condition will be returned.

<img alt="table relationships" src="/img/databases/relationships.svg">

In this example of tables above ðŸ‘†, it would return all the heroes, because every hero has a `team_id`, so every hero can be joined with the `team` table:

<table>
<tr>
<th>id</th><th>name</th><th>name</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td><td>Deadpond</td><td>Z-Force</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td><td>Rusty-Man</td><td>Preventers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td><td>Spider-Boy</td><td>Preventers</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Foreign Keys with `NULL`

But in the database that we are working with in the code above, **Spider-Boy** doesn't have any team, the value of `team_id` is `NULL` in the database.

So there's no way to join the **Spider-Boy** row with some row in the `team` table:

<img alt="table relationships" src="/img/tutorial/relationships/select/relationships2.svg">

Running the same SQL we used above, the resulting table would not include **Spider-Boy** ðŸ˜±:

<table>
<tr>
<th>id</th><th>name</th><th>name</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td><td>Deadpond</td><td>Z-Force</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td><td>Rusty-Man</td><td>Preventers</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Include Everything on the `LEFT OUTER`

In this case, that we want to include all heroes in the result even if they don't have a team, we can extend that same SQL using a `JOIN` from above and add a `LEFT OUTER` right before `JOIN`:

```SQL hl_lines="3"
SELECT hero.id, hero.name, team.name
FROM hero
LEFT OUTER JOIN team
ON hero.team_id = team.id
```

This `LEFT OUTER` part tells the database that we want to keep everything on the first table, the one on the `LEFT` in the imaginary space, even if those rows would be left **out**, so we want it to include the `OUTER` rows too. In this case, every hero with or without a team.

And that would return the following result, including **Spider-Boy** ðŸŽ‰:

<table>
<tr>
<th>id</th><th>name</th><th>name</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td><td>Deadpond</td><td>Z-Force</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td><td>Rusty-Man</td><td>Preventers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td><td>Spider-Boy</td><td>null</td>
</tr>
</table>

!!! tip
    The only difference between this query and the previous is that extra `LEFT OUTER`.

And here's another of the SQL variations, you could write `LEFT OUTER JOIN` or just `LEFT JOIN`, it means the same.

## Join Tables in **SQLModel** with `LEFT OUTER`

Now let's replicate the same query in **SQLModel**.

`.join()` has a parameter we can use `isouter=True` to make the `JOIN` be a `LEFT OUTER JOIN`:

```Python hl_lines="5"
# Code above omitted ðŸ‘†

{!./docs_src/tutorial/connect/select/tutorial003.py[ln:63-68]!}

# Code below omitted ðŸ‘‡
```

<details>
<summary>ðŸ‘€ Full file preview</summary>

```Python
{!./docs_src/tutorial/connect/select/tutorial003.py!}
```

</details>

And if we run it, it will output:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python app.py

// Previous output omitted ðŸ˜‰

// SELECT using LEFT OUTER JOIN
INFO Engine SELECT hero.id, hero.name, hero.secret_name, hero.age, hero.team_id, team.id AS id_1, team.name AS name_1, team.headquarters
FROM hero LEFT OUTER JOIN team ON team.id = hero.team_id

INFO Engine [no key 0.00051s] ()

// Print the first hero and team
Hero: id=1 secret_name='Dive Wilson' team_id=2 name='Deadpond' age=None Team: headquarters='Sister Margaretâ€™s Bar' id=2 name='Z-Force'
// Print the second hero and team
Hero: id=2 secret_name='Tommy Sharp' team_id=1 name='Rusty-Man' age=48 Team: headquarters='Sharp Tower' id=1 name='Preventers'
// Print the third hero and team, we included Spider-Boy ðŸŽ‰
Hero: id=3 secret_name='Pedro Parqueador' team_id=None name='Spider-Boy' age=None Team: None
```

</div>

## What Goes in `select()`

You might be wondering why we put the `Team` in the `select()` and not just in the `.join()`.

And then why we didn't include `Hero` in the `.join()`. ðŸ¤”

In SQLModel (actually in SQLAlchemy), all these functions and tools try to **replicate** how it would be to work with the **SQL** language.

Remember that [`SELECT` defines the columns to get and `WHERE` how to filter them?](../where.md#select-and-where){.internal-link target=_blank}.

This also applies here, but with `JOIN` and `ON`.

### Select Only Heroes But Join with Teams

If we only put the `Team` in the `.join()` and not in the `select()` function, we would not get the `team` data.

But we would still be able to **filter** the rows with it. ðŸ¤“

We could even add some additional `.where()` after `.join()` to filter the data more, for example to return only the heroes from one team:

```Python hl_lines="5"
# Code above omitted ðŸ‘†

{!./docs_src/tutorial/connect/select/tutorial004.py[ln:63-68]!}

# Code below omitted ðŸ‘‡
```

<details>
<summary>ðŸ‘€ Full file preview</summary>

```Python
{!./docs_src/tutorial/connect/select/tutorial004.py!}
```

</details>

Here we are **filtering** with `.where()` to get only the heroes that belong to the **Preventers** team.

But we are still only requesting the data from the heroes, not their teams.

If we run that, it would output:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python app.py

// Select only the hero data
INFO Engine SELECT hero.id, hero.name, hero.secret_name, hero.age, hero.team_id
// But still join with the team table
FROM hero JOIN team ON team.id = hero.team_id
// And filter with WHERE to get only the Preventers
WHERE team.name = ?
INFO Engine [no key 0.00066s] ('Preventers',)

// We filter with the team, but only get the hero
Preventer Hero: id=2 secret_name='Tommy Sharp' team_id=1 name='Rusty-Man' age=48
```

</div>

### Include the `Team`

By putting the `Team` in `select()` we tell **SQLModel** and the database that we want the team data too.

```Python hl_lines="5"
# Code above omitted ðŸ‘†

{!./docs_src/tutorial/connect/select/tutorial005.py[ln:63-68]!}

# Code below omitted ðŸ‘‡
```

<details>
<summary>ðŸ‘€ Full file preview</summary>

```Python
{!./docs_src/tutorial/connect/select/tutorial005.py!}
```

</details>

And if we run that, it will output:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ python app.py

// Select the hero and the team data
INFO Engine SELECT hero.id, hero.name, hero.secret_name, hero.age, hero.team_id, team.id AS id_1, team.name AS name_1, team.headquarters
// Join the hero with the team table
FROM hero JOIN team ON team.id = hero.team_id
// Filter with WHERE to get only Preventers
WHERE team.name = ?
INFO Engine [no key 0.00018s] ('Preventers',)

// Print the hero and the team
Preventer Hero: id=2 secret_name='Tommy Sharp' team_id=1 name='Rusty-Man' age=48 Team: headquarters='Sharp Tower' id=1 name='Preventers'
```

</div>

We still have to `.join()` because otherwise it would just compute all the possible combinations of heroes and teams, for example including **Rusty-Man** with **Preventers** and also **Rusty-Man** with **Z-Force**, which would be a mistake.

## Relationship Attributes

Here we have been using the pure class models directly, but in a future chapter we will also see how to use **Relationship Attributes** that let us interact with the database in a way much more close to the code with Python objects.

And we will also see how to load their data in a different, simpler way, achieving the same we achieved here. âœ¨
