# Create Data with Many-to-Many Relationships

Let's continue from where we left and create some data.

We'll create data for this same **many-to-many** relationship with a link table:

We'll continue from where we left off with the previous code.

## Create Heroes

As we have done before, we'll create a function `create_heroes()` and we'll create some teams and heroes in it:

```Python hl_lines="11"
# Code above omitted ðŸ‘†

{!./docs_src/tutorial/many_to_many/tutorial001.py[ln:42-60]!}

# Code below omitted ðŸ‘‡
```

<details>
<summary>ðŸ‘€ Full file preview</summary>

```Python
{!./docs_src/tutorial/many_to_many/tutorial001.py!}
```

</details>

This is very similar to what we have done before.

We create a couple of teams, and then three heroes.

The only new detail is that instead of using an argument `team` we now use `teams`, because that is the name of the new **relationship attribute**. And more importantly, we pass a **list of teams** (even if it contains a single team).

See how **Deadpond** now belongs to the two teams?

## Commit, Refresh, and Print

Now let's do as we have done before, `commit` the **session**, `refresh` the data, and print it:

```Python hl_lines="22-25  27-29  31-36"
# Code above omitted ðŸ‘†

{!./docs_src/tutorial/many_to_many/tutorial001.py[ln:42-75]!}

# Code below omitted ðŸ‘‡
```

<details>
<summary>ðŸ‘€ Full file preview</summary>

```Python
{!./docs_src/tutorial/many_to_many/tutorial001.py!}
```

</details>

## Add to Main

As before, add the `create_heroes()` function to the `main()` function to make sure it is called when running this program from the command line:

```Python hl_lines="22-25  27-29  31-36"
# Code above omitted ðŸ‘†

{!./docs_src/tutorial/many_to_many/tutorial001.py[ln:78-80]!}

# Code below omitted ðŸ‘‡
```

<details>
<summary>ðŸ‘€ Full file preview</summary>

```Python
{!./docs_src/tutorial/many_to_many/tutorial001.py!}
```

</details>

## Run the Program

If we run the program from the command line, it would output:

<div class="termy">

```console

## Recap

After setting up the model link, using it with **relationship attributes** is fairly straightforward, just Python objects. âœ¨
